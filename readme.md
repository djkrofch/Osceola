## Osceola CFLRP LANDIS-II Modeling
 
#### Project description 
This notebook is a collection of my work related to the Osceola critical forested landscape research program (CFLRP), in support of Joint Fire Science Program funded research. 
This repo serves to disseminate analysis and code contributions made toward the JFSP proposal entitled 'Outcomes prioritization on fuel treatment placement in extreme fire 
weather in 3 CFLRP landscapes', specifically the Osceola National Forest.

#### Notebook structure

I am working on breaking up the project into components of data preparation, analysis, and figure generation. For the time being, this is a crude compilation
of primarily data curation and analysis, which I will refine into specific components following publication of the research. two primary notebooks focusing on model
parameterization and output generation, currently house the majority of geospatial and analytical contributions made toward the OSNF portion of this funded research.

The repository will ultimately hold presentations and summary figures, along with the full notebook driven analysis framework, that resulted in the publications
that follow the analysis. Static links to the publically available datasets will be provided following the completion of model simulations, data curation, and ultimately
publication of the results.

#### Motivation

Beyond backing up my workflow, I aim to document the research process in this format moving forward as a way to guide my thought process, account for my time,
and share analysis frameworks and figures with colleagues and collaborators. I hope that this coupled data, presentation, notebook format will provide a
transparent platform on which to conduct research, handle version control, and disseminate results to students, scientists, and the public.
