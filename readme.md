## Osceola CFLRP LANDIS-II Modeling
 
#### Project description 
This notebook is a collection of my work related to the Osceola critical forested landscape research program (CFLRP), in support of Joint Fire Science Program funded research. 
A detailed description of the project justification will come in time, for now its just a repo to document progress and disseminate code / analysis
frameworks to colleagues and collaborators.

#### Notebook structure

I am working on breaking up the project into components of data preparation, analysis, and figure generation. For the time being, this is a crude compilation
of primarily data curation and analysis, which I will refine into specific components in the coming weeks. Fire weather and fuels parameterization
chunks are packaged up at this point as finished products, everything else is a work in progress.

#### Motivation

Beyond backing up my workflow, I aim to document the research process in this format moving forward as a way to guide my thought process, account for my time,
and share analysis frameworks and figures with colleagues and collaborators. I hope that this notebook format will provide a more transparent platform on which
to conduct research, and disseminate results to students, scientists, and the public.
