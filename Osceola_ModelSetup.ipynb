    "#### Ecoregion generation\n",
    "First step toward building the Osceola into LANDIS-II is to generate ecoregions -- climatically and edaphically similar areas, wherein soil and climate will provide the same drivers for vegetation growth. The Osceola isn't a huge area (~90k ha) and also is not exceptionally mountainous. This should make creating ecoregions a simple affair. \n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy will be to leverage GSSURGO data to describe the major soil types across the landscape, and look for differences in for example water holding capacity. Then we will overlay those differences with crude elevation bands, using elevation as a surrogate for climate -- so long as precipitation and temperature appear to vary across an elevation gradient within the study area."

    "This always gives me a headache. So here are the steps I used to make sense of the GSSURGO data once its downloaded. \n",
    "1. Load the MapunitRaster into a GIS of your  choice\n",
    "2. Import two data tables, 'chorizon' and 'component'. I don't understand the naming convention here, chorizon isn't a word, so presumably this stands for c horizon, as the table has a lot of soil horizon data -- clay, sand, silt at various depths etc. However the same logic cannot be applied to 'component', as c omponent doesn't make any sense...\n",
    "3. Create a spatial join between the MapunitRaster and 'component' using 'MUKEY' from the MapunitRaster (presumably standing for Mapunit Key) and 'Mapunit Key' from 'component'. Why both columns aren't called the same thing, when in fact they represent the same data ...\n",
    "4. Create a spatial join between MapunitRaster and 'chorizon' using the newly acquired 'Component Key' from MapunitRaster.component. 'chorizon' has the same name for its 'Component Key' column, just to futher add to the confusion via a moment of clarity.\n",
    "5. Now you have access to the spatial data from 'chorizon' and 'component' on a per MapunitRaster basis."
