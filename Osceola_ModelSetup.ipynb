    "First step toward building the Osceola into LANDIS-II is to generate ecoregions -- climatically and edaphically similar areas, wherein soil and climate will provide the same drivers for vegetation growth. The Osceola isn't a huge area (~90k ha) and also is not exceptionally mountainous. This should make creating ecoregions a simple affair. \n",
